 |      Description:   Write a Java program that accepts 10 integers through the
 |                     console and places them in an array.  Your input should only
 |                     accept 10 numbers and only integers.  The program should
 |                     calculate and display the average of the ten numbers on the console
 |
 |      Language:  Java
